   <article style="text-align: center;"><pre>Don't search about the lore
    Even don't recall (So uninstall)
    When you try to explore
    It starts to play with a doll
    
    Knock, knock
    Got an unavoidable invite?
    Did you think it's a parasite?
    When you realize it, the Red Room has already trapped you inside
    
    Do you like the Red Room?
    Do-do you like the Red Room?
    Do you like the Red Room?
    Do-do you like do-do you like
    
    Knock, knock
    You can't stop these spreading crimson
    Just like flooding blood, can't be redone
    Dusty monitor shows you a vision, bad wicked one
    Click, click
    You are now entering the Red Room
    Full of aged computer perfume
    It will surely grab your arms and drag into a true doom
    
    Small advertise appears
    Close in a second (As a habit)
    It brings the fate of fear
    New scapegoat is beckoned
    
    Knock, knock
    Your room will be filled with puce shades
    Windows break up like a parade
    When you deny it, the Red Room coats you redder than pomegranate
    
    Do you like the Red Room?
    Do-do you like the Red Room?
    Do you like the Red Room?
    Do-do you like do-do you like
    
    Knock, knock
    You can't stop these spreading crimson
    Just like flooding blood, can't be redone
    Dusty monitor shows you a vision, bad wicked one
    Click, click
    You are now entering the Red Room
    Full of aged computer perfume
    It will surely grab your arms and drag into a true doom
    (In the Red Room)
    You are awaited by gloom
    (In the Red Room)
    You can't escape from the Red Room</pre></article>
